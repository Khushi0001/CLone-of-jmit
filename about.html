                    institutions spread over Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and owe their existence to the munificent
                    and philanthropic spirit of Seth Mukand Lal, a close adherent of Gandhi Ji. He came under the
                    Gandhian influence in earlier twenties. Gandhi ji had fondly nick-named him “Pagla Bhagat”. Seth
                    Mukand Lal reportedly bore the entire expenditure incurred in the holding of All India Congress
                    Sessions on the banks of river Ravi, Lahore in 1929 where resolution for complete independence of
                    India was adopted. Illiterate himself, he vowed to dispel the darkness of ignorance by opening
                    educational institutions in the part of the country. Hence, he established Mukand Lal National High
                    School at Abdullapur (now Yamuna Nagar) as the first institution of the Mukand chain.
                    Seth Jai Parkash, his illustrious son accelerated the pace of opening institutions in the name of
                    his father. A selfless man, he motivated the rich, particularly the business community by saying
                    “Rain water accumulates on the roof top without an outlet, shall bring down the roof. Likewise,
                    wealth without charity will ruin the household of wealthy”. He acted on this principle till the last
                    and contributed large sums of money to the educational institutions.
